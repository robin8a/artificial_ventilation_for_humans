# Summary

USE THIS DESIGN AT YOUR OWN RISK AND KEEP THE WORKING ASSEMBLY AWAY FROM SMALL CHILDREN. IT MIGHT TAKE OFF A CHILD'S FINGER TIP AT HIGHER SPEEDS.

I really liked the concept of Landru's Dremel Turbine. I decided to try to make something smaller that blows a lot of air.  I also wanted to be able to mount it and remove it without having to disassemble it.

This one was designed to fit and tested on the battery powered Dremel 8100.

This one uses an impeller design from Grabcad that I modified. I scaled the impeller down to be the same diameter as Landru's. I may make a larger version later, stay tuned.I took out every other blade and reversed the direction of the blade ends where they are throwing the air out of the nozzle.  No engineering involved, just thinking about how it would work.

The other change I made is that this one mounts right onto the "Dremel chuck" via a press fit. It is tight enough to stay on without something retaining it.

Some other remixes added the option for a grill to be a separate piece. I started out with that route and decide to just integrate it as a permanent piece since it was a good safety feature.  You can still stick your fingers in to the blade, but it is a little harder to do it unintentionally.  This should only be used as a blower, not as a vacuum.

I went through several iterations of housing and impeller designs before I settled on the ones reflected by the STLs.

It is designed to be assembled with three 12mm long M4 socket head screws and matching nuts.

The impeller is printed flat side down with NO SUPPORT. If you use Simplify 3d it will want to add a few supports between several impeller fins. They are not needed. Turn off supports for the impeller.
The base is printed with the top surface flat side down (i.e. upside down) WITH SUPPORTS
The cover is printed top side up (right side up) WITH SUPPORTS.

I uploaded two almost identical impeller files. The one with 1-14 in its name is slightly looser than the one with 1-16.  the 1-16 file does not fit my chuck. I may make one that is in between the two, however the 1-14 version stays on MY Dremel's chuck.

6-10-19, just uploaded an impeller for a chuck with two flat sides based on measurements from a commenter.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK2S
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: HIgh for the impeller, medium for the base, variable for the cover, but 0,2 will work fine.
Infill: 20%
Filament_brand: Inland
Filament_color: Any
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
I printed the impeller with 30% fill and 3 layers and no support at a fine layer setting on a Prusa.
The enclosure parts were printed with support. It could be done at 0.2 or 0.25 layer height. I did it with with the variable settings feature in Simplify 3D to make the low angled nozzle and the intake top more cosmetically appealing with less stepping.

The cover STL has a honeycomb structure that comes up to 0.5 mm from the bottom of the grill. I will upload two versions of the impeller, one with this structure and one without it.

Besides using Landru's design as an overall inspiration and for size, I did use the thread section for mounting it to the Dremel. The threads are excellent.

This has been verified to fit a Dremel 8100.

Once I attach the cover with screws, I am going to do a test to see how long it takes to blow up a garbage bag. It puts out a high speed stream of air from the small nozzle. If I had a wind gauge I would measure that also.


# Air flow rate, video

## Estimated airflow

Based on our admittedly rough tests, this blower can put out about 11 CFM.

Video length 8 seconds
13 gallon bag
Estimated filled to 11 gallons  (1.47 cubic feet)

Cubic Feet/Minute= 1.47 CF  x (60 seconds/min)/(8 sec to fill bag) = 11 CFM

Calculated nozzle velocity is 160-180mph at full RPM.  This seems like the right calculation in the image below, But please correct me if I am wrong.
