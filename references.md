# Open Lung
Low Resource Bag Valve Mask (BVM) Ventilator
This project was jumpstarted by the COVID-19 global pandemic as a result of community discussion on a facebook group called Open Source COVID19 and OpenSourceVentilator, this is why I created a GitLab project for a new open source product called OpenLung.

# Design and Prototyping of a Low-cost Portable Mechanical Ventilator 
This paper describes the design and prototyping of a low-cost portable mechanical ventilator for
use in mass casualty cases and resource-poor environments. The ventilator delivers breaths by
compressing a conventional bag-valve mask (BVM) with a pivoting cam arm, eliminating the
need for a human operator for the BVM. An initial prototype was built out of acrylic, measuring
11.25 x 6.7 x 8 inches (285 x 170 x 200 mm) and weighing 9 lbs (4.1 kg).
